## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `reg-gradescope-stats`: per-outcome **item analysis** from Gradescope *Export Evaluations*. Joins each rubric-item column back to the exam's `form·Qn·slot` keys in the grading note, computing per-question difficulty (p-value) and per-distractor selection counts.
  - Flags **non-functioning distractors** (chosen by 0), **distractors more popular than the key**, and a **miskey alarm** (a credited item applied yet the question mean is 0 → rubric point value misset in Gradescope).
  - Robust join: exact text → MC `(letter)` prefix (survives prose typos) → no-answer/blank → order outcome; excludes the Gradescope `Rubric Numbers` legend row and impossible-score rows.
  - Emits three artifacts: `ITEM_ANALYSIS.md` (Obsidian-tagged report), `item_analysis.html` (a self-contained newspaper/agate **Item Analysis broadsheet**), and `item_analysis.json` (downstream analytics). Can splice a *Post-exam statistics* link section into the grading note (`--link-grading-note`).
  - New module `lectern.gradescope_stats` + `references/item_analysis.template.html`.
- `reg-gradebook build` + `reg-gradebook export-canvas`: **vault-native gradebook** — the vault is the grade source of truth; grades flow vault → Canvas (inverting the Canvas → vault `import` path).
  - `build` rolls per-component score files into `gradebook.csv` (+ `gradebook.md` cockpit) via a per-section `components.yaml` registry that binds each scores file (`sid`, `score`, `status`) to a `gradebook-schema` column.
  - **In-progress current standing**: `compute_weighted(graded_only=…)` renormalizes group weights over graded work, so a partly-graded term is not scored all-F and converges to the full-schema final once every column is graded.
  - Roster handling: off-roster students with a real grade (e.g. a new enrollee) are kept and flagged `stale-roster`; a non-roster student who only no-showed is treated as dropped and excluded from the gradebook.
  - `export-canvas` emits a Canvas bulk-upload CSV (`SIS User ID` + one column per graded component) for pushing grades back to Canvas; ungraded components get no column (never upload-zeroes work that isn't done).
  - New module `lectern.gradebook_build`; legacy `reg-gradebook import` (Canvas → vault) retained for reconciliation.
- `exam_pack` module: pack-mode exam build via `exam.build.yaml` manifest
  - Multi-form (A/B/C) support with hand-authored form variants
  - Per-student individualized builds (pre-filled NAME/ID, unique footer serials)
  - Form-assignment policies: `alternating`, `seeded-random`, `every-form`
  - Gradescope product emission: `region` (template/key/outline) and `bubble` (bubble key/outline)
  - Gradescope **grading note** (`GRADING_NOTE.md`): one self-contained, ISA-ready Markdown grading guide per exam — exam identity, Gradescope setup steps, and a per-form answer-key + rubric table. Emitted whenever a `gradescope:` target is set. Because Gradescope imports no key or rubric, this is the human crib a grader (especially a TA who did not author the exam) works from.
  - Per-question `% name:` / `% rubric:` LaTeX annotations: authored in the exam `.tex`, they supply the grading note's question names and rubric criteria. `% name:` is required on every question; `% rubric:` is required on `fib`/`code` items and optional (defaults to all-or-nothing) on `mc`/`tf`.
  - Consolidated `register.csv` with `form` column spanning all forms
- `reg-exam-build` now dispatches on input type: `.tex` for legacy single-source mode, `.yaml` for pack mode
- Per-student identity block: `\fieldline` + `\identityinstruction` macros pre-fill student name and ID on individualized copies; student only adds the date
- `references/reference_exam.tex`: canonical A.2 exam skeleton with all per-student macros, single-source answer key toggle, color conventions, and Gradescope-additive rubric structure

### Fixed
- `exam_pack`: fill-in-the-blank answers in `<form>_outline.csv` are no longer truncated to the first blank — multi-blank FIB answers (e.g. `confusion; diffusion`) are preserved in full.

### Documentation
- `docs/design/exam-system.md`: multi-form exam system design, build matrix, defensibility
- `docs/design/exam-tex-format.md`: house `.tex` format standard, serial computation, appeals runbook
- `docs/gradescope-workflow.md`: Gradescope region/bubble workflow, A/B Version Sets, roster
