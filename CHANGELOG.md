## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`reg-lab-report deliver --from-note` — the grading-round note is authoritative.** Each grading round is one giant vault note (`recon-<lab>/REPORT.md`) holding cohort facts, grades, and every student's feedback, edited in place as you grade. `--from-note <REPORT.md>` (mutually exclusive with `--cohort`) parses the per-student blocks (`lectern.feedback_note`) and renders each repo's `FEEDBACK.md` straight from the note, so hand-authored feedback is never re-derived from a digest cohort and clobbered. The block grammar (`### Name — **total / grand**` · backtick-quoted github id · a `·`-delimited `Label n/max` score line with `+` extra-credit · `_Comments:_`) is a contract; `__`/`—` marks ungraded rows, which delivery skips. `render_feedback_md` generalizes to N components (not just Wards/Grimoire), and `FEEDBACK_LOG.md` renders the component breakdown for note-path entries. The signed feedback-branch → PR-close → signed merge-to-main flow, dry-run default, and idempotency are unchanged. Fits lectern doctrine: the vault is the proprietary record; the tool is a deterministic renderer over a parseable contract. (Design: `docs/design/feedback-from-note.md`.)
- **`reg-lab-report` — lectern Layer 3 (instructor report + feedback delivery).** Two subcommands. `render` consumes the recon bundle + the digest-merged cohort + optional gradebook standing and deterministically produces the canonical instructor `REPORT.md` — distribution stats, Unicode **agate charts** (grade distribution, score histogram, ward-clear funnel), the ➊ grade table, a four-bucket **grading-recommendations** engine (confirm / edge-cases / low-confidence / upward-adjustment candidates), a roster-ordered Canvas entry sheet, and the Part-A-facts / Part-B-advisory firewall. This supersedes the agent-assembled `docs/recon-report-workflow.md` as the REPORT producer. `deliver` posts a sanitized, GPG-signed `FEEDBACK.md` (grade breakdown + student-facing comment) to each repo's `feedback` branch, closes the feedback PR, **then merges `feedback` into the default branch (`main`) so the file is visible on the student's repo home** — a signed merge commit, with a signed direct-add fallback for Classroom repos whose `main`/`feedback` have unrelated histories (no common ancestor). **`--dry-run` by default**, signing mandatory on both the feedback commit and the merge (refuses unsigned), idempotent on the feedback branch *and* on main independently (`--no-merge-main` opts out), and it emits a verbatim `FEEDBACK_LOG.md` record. Golden-tested against the CECS 378 Su26 Lab 1 (Spellbreaker) cohort.
- **Sanitization lint (`lectern.feedback_sanitize`).** Deterministic guard that withholds any student-facing comment leaking internal jargon (triage verdicts, honor-gate, advisory framing) or another student's name. Deliberately excludes crypto-colliding words (`oracle`, `digest`) so legitimate feedback isn't censored.

### Changed
- **`reg-lab-digest` results now carry a `student_comment`** — a sanitized, student-facing comment alongside the internal terse `comment`. One grading pass yields both; `merge` runs the sanitize lint and withholds the student comment on low-confidence/abstain or any lint hit. Additive, backward-compatible schema change to the Layer-2 contract (the grader-prompt doc documents the new field).
- **True/False exam questions now use stacked `(a) True / (b) False` choices** — the house standard documented in `references/reference_exam.tex` and `docs/design/exam-tex-format.md`. The previous inline `\textsc{T~/~F.}` form listed no answer options on their own lines, so Gradescope's region detection could not find them. The `\textsc{T~/~F.}` label and inline `Answer:` reveal are retained, so questions stay typed `tf` and `parse_outline_from_tex` still emits `True`/`False` in `_outline.csv` — no code change, purely an authoring-convention fix.
- **Refreshed the `examples/cecs-378-demo` worked example** to cover the current command surface. The demo exam gains a stacked-T/F section and a `gradescope: region` build (emitting `gradescope/` + `GRADING_NOTE.md`), and the README adds runnable stages for `reg-syllabus` (stamp + build), `reg-qbank` (validate + emit), `reg-exam-readinglist` (Lectern→Scriptorium seam), and `reg-gradescope-stats` (item analysis), plus a documented "requires live infrastructure" section for the Classroom / ISA-publish / triage / term-finalize verbs.

### Known gaps
- **`reg-exam-build` GRADING_NOTE.md ≠ `reg-gradescope-stats` input format.** The build emits a summary-table grading note (`| Q | Name | Pts | Type | Answer | Rubric |`); `reg-gradescope-stats` parses the richer per-question form (`#### <Form>·Q<n> · … · <TYPE>` + `| Pts | Key | Rubric item |`). The demo's gradescope-stats stage uses a hand-authored stats-compatible note; bridging the two is a tracked follow-up.

### Security
- **Vendored `slugify`, dropped the `vaultkit` dependency** — the name `vaultkit` on PyPI is an unrelated third-party SDK, so depending on it was a dependency-confusion risk. The one helper used (`slugify`) is now inlined in `lectern/_text.py`, making the public distribution self-contained with no private/ambiguous dependency.

### Fixed
- **Declared the `pdfplumber` dependency** that was previously undeclared: added to the `dev` extra (the test suite imports it directly) and to a new optional `verify` extra. `reg-exam-verify` prefers pdfplumber for footer-serial extraction but falls back to the `pdftotext` CLI, so it stays optional at runtime — not a hard dependency.
- **`reg-exam-build` single layout — grading-note verify path.** The grading note's appeals command pointed `reg-exam-verify` at `build/.parts/`, double-counting the `.parts/` prefix the register's `output_pdf` already carries, so every paper reported "missing." Verify dir is `build/` in both print layouts now (with a regression test).
- **`reg-term-create` — stringify `class_number` in the emitted manifest.** YAML parses a bare numeric CRN as an int, which failed `manifest_schema`'s `string | null` validation; the class number is now emitted as a string. Surfaced on the Su26 378-01 maiden voyage.
- **Test config — `pythonpath = ["."]`.** The digest test modules cross-import shared fixtures via `from tests.test_x import …`, which resolved under `python -m pytest` (repo root on `sys.path`) but not under CI's bare `pytest -q`. The repo root is now on `sys.path` via pytest config so both invocations collect cleanly.

### Added
- **LMS-suite integration test + documentation.** A cross-component `tests/integration/` suite (lectern as the hub) behind an opt-in `suite` pytest marker, enforcing the three seam contracts: the live Lectern→Scriptorium reading-list seam (skip-gated), the golden Oracle→Lectern `result.json` autograde seam, and a strict-xfail gap-guard for the Scriptorium→Lectern question-bank format gap. Adds `SUITE.md` (release-compatibility matrix) + `reg-suite-check` (new module `lectern.suite_check`, a documented parser of the version-constraint mini-language), the `docs/design/lms-suite-integration.md` guide, and an opt-in CI `suite-integration` job (Node + Scriptorium checkout). See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-lms-suite-integration-design.md`.
- **`reg-lab-digest`** — Layer-2 **writeup digest** (the advisory complement to the autograder). `emit` reads a recon bundle + a structured rubric YAML and writes a per-repo grading work-list + output JSON-Schema; the LLM grading runs in the **harness via a documented contract** (no API dependency in lectern); `merge` validates the graded results and writes advisory writeup scores + one-line rationale comments into the cohort sheet. Deterministic guardrails enforced in code, never trusted to the model: partial-ward zeroing from the autograde truth, authoritative total recompute (`min(cap, Σ)`), confidence/abstain gating. **Never writes the gradebook** — promotion stays a separate human-confirmed step. Ships the Spellbreaker rubric (`templates/spellbreaker.rubric.yaml`) + the grader-prompt contract; first validated end-to-end on a real CECS 378 Lab 1 cohort. New modules `lectern.digest_{rubric,schema,emit,merge}` + `lectern.lab_digest`.
- **`reg-lab-recon`** — sweep a lab's student-repo population into a deterministic **recon bundle** (Part A facts): per-repo autograde points (parsed from CI logs — robust to `continue-on-error`-masked job conclusions), honor gate, commit-pattern triage, and structural writeup facts → `cohort.csv` + `FACTS.md` + a two-tier (verified-record / advisory) cohort-intelligence `REPORT.md`. Advisory; no student graded without human review. New modules `lectern.recon_*`.
- **`reg-triage`** — git-history authenticity triage for GitHub Classroom submissions (`init`/`sweep`/`report`/`rhythm`); two-tier audit doc, advisory-only, 100% human review. Ships with synthetic demo fixtures.
- **`reg-syllabus`** — syllabus generation with a tamper-evident control-number serial (`stamp`/`build`).
- **`reg-gradescope-stats`** — per-outcome item analysis from Gradescope Export Evaluations.
- **Gradebook ledger** — `reg-gradebook build` now emits a navigable grades ledger (bookkeeping model: single-entry with source-document reconciliation):
  - **`GRADEBOOK.md`** — a grouped general ledger: components by weight category (Assignments / Midterms / Final) with per-group subtotals → standing; ungraded cells render `·` (never `0`), in-progress `*`; each component header wikilinks its assignment page. Plus a live per-student statement view (DataviewJS).
  - **`assignments/<short>.md`** — a subsidiary ledger per component. Exam pages carry the score roster (n/mean/median/σ + distribution), links + an `![[ITEM_ANALYSIS]]` embed, and a collapsible per-student×question grid **per form** (A/B).
  - **Reconciliation** — every assignment page reconciles grid totals to recorded scores: true value mismatches surface under an *Out of balance* danger callout; roster differences (e.g. no-shows with a recorded score but no submission) surface as informational *Reconciling items* — surfaced, never silently absorbed.
  - `components.yaml` gains optional `link:` / `analysis:` (assignment + item-analysis wikilinks), `breakdown:` (per-student×question matrix; accepts a glob/list for multi-form exams), and `kind:` (exam/lab/reading).
  - `reg-gradescope-stats` emits a per-student×question `item_scores_<form>.csv` matrix (the grid + reconciliation source).
  - New module `lectern.gradebook_ledger`.

### Changed
- **BREAKING — `reg-term-create` materializes term specs + semester notes under `classes/semesters/`.** Term input specs and the semester rollup note moved from the `classes/` root to `classes/semesters/<term>.{md,spec.yaml}`. Existing specs at the old path must be moved to the new location.
- **`reg-exam-build` print layout — one combined PDF per exam, not one file per student.** New manifest key `print_layout: single | per-form` (default **`single`**). In `single`, the per-student serialized copies are merged into a single `<exam-slug>_combined.pdf` for the whole roster (all forms, canonical-name order) — the printable deliverable is exactly one file; the per-student copies become build intermediates under `build/.parts/` (still referenced by `register.csv`'s `output_pdf`, so `reg-exam-verify` and one-off reprints work). `print_layout: per-form` restores the prior behavior (per-form `<id>_combined.pdf` stacks, loose per-student PDFs in `build/`). `reg-exam-verify --dir build/` works unchanged in both layouts (the register's `output_pdf` carries the `.parts/` prefix in `single`).
- `reg-gradebook build` no longer emits the legacy standalone `gradebook.md` cockpit — the new `GRADEBOOK.md` ledger supersedes it. (`render_view` is retained for the legacy Canvas→vault `import` path; the class-note cockpit reads `gradebook.csv` directly and is unaffected.)
- `reg-gradescope-stats`: per-outcome **item analysis** from Gradescope *Export Evaluations*. Joins each rubric-item column back to the exam's `form·Qn·slot` keys in the grading note, computing per-question difficulty (p-value) and per-distractor selection counts.
  - Flags **non-functioning distractors** (chosen by 0), **distractors more popular than the key**, and a **miskey alarm** (a credited item applied yet the question mean is 0 → rubric point value misset in Gradescope).
  - Robust join: exact text → MC `(letter)` prefix (survives prose typos) → no-answer/blank → order outcome; excludes the Gradescope `Rubric Numbers` legend row and impossible-score rows.
  - Emits three artifacts: `ITEM_ANALYSIS.md` (Obsidian-tagged report), `item_analysis.html` (a self-contained newspaper/agate **Item Analysis broadsheet**), and `item_analysis.json` (downstream analytics). Can splice a *Post-exam statistics* link section into the grading note (`--link-grading-note`).
  - New module `lectern.gradescope_stats` + `references/item_analysis.template.html`.
- `reg-gradebook build` + `reg-gradebook export-canvas`: **vault-native gradebook** — the vault is the grade source of truth; grades flow vault → Canvas (inverting the Canvas → vault `import` path).
  - `build` rolls per-component score files into `gradebook.csv` (+ `gradebook.md` cockpit) via a per-section `components.yaml` registry that binds each scores file (`sid`, `score`, `status`) to a `gradebook-schema` column.
  - **In-progress current standing**: `compute_weighted(graded_only=…)` renormalizes group weights over graded work, so a partly-graded term is not scored all-F and converges to the full-schema final once every column is graded.
  - Roster handling: off-roster students with a real grade (e.g. a new enrollee) are kept and flagged `stale-roster`; a non-roster student who only no-showed is treated as dropped and excluded from the gradebook.
  - `export-canvas` emits a Canvas bulk-upload CSV (`SIS User ID` + one column per graded component) for pushing grades back to Canvas; ungraded components get no column (never upload-zeroes work that isn't done).
  - New module `lectern.gradebook_build`; legacy `reg-gradebook import` (Canvas → vault) retained for reconciliation.
- `exam_pack` module: pack-mode exam build via `exam.build.yaml` manifest
  - Multi-form (A/B/C) support with hand-authored form variants
  - Per-student individualized builds (pre-filled NAME/ID, unique footer serials)
  - Form-assignment policies: `alternating`, `seeded-random`, `every-form`
  - Gradescope product emission: `region` (template/key/outline) and `bubble` (bubble key/outline)
  - Gradescope **grading note** (`GRADING_NOTE.md`): one self-contained, ISA-ready Markdown grading guide per exam — exam identity, Gradescope setup steps, and a per-form answer-key + rubric table. Emitted whenever a `gradescope:` target is set. Because Gradescope imports no key or rubric, this is the human crib a grader (especially a TA who did not author the exam) works from.
  - Per-question `% name:` / `% rubric:` LaTeX annotations: authored in the exam `.tex`, they supply the grading note's question names and rubric criteria. `% name:` is required on every question; `% rubric:` is required on `fib`/`code` items and optional (defaults to all-or-nothing) on `mc`/`tf`.
  - Consolidated `register.csv` with `form` column spanning all forms
- `reg-exam-build` now dispatches on input type: `.tex` for legacy single-source mode, `.yaml` for pack mode
- Per-student identity block: `\fieldline` + `\identityinstruction` macros pre-fill student name and ID on individualized copies; student only adds the date
- `references/reference_exam.tex`: canonical A.2 exam skeleton with all per-student macros, single-source answer key toggle, color conventions, and Gradescope-additive rubric structure

### Fixed
- `exam_pack`: fill-in-the-blank answers in `<form>_outline.csv` are no longer truncated to the first blank — multi-blank FIB answers (e.g. `confusion; diffusion`) are preserved in full.

### Documentation
- `docs/design/exam-system.md`: multi-form exam system design, build matrix, defensibility
- `docs/design/exam-tex-format.md`: house `.tex` format standard, serial computation, appeals runbook
- `docs/gradescope-workflow.md`: Gradescope region/bubble workflow, A/B Version Sets, roster
